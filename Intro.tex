In these notes we are going to prove the isoperimetric inequality in \(\R^n\), characterizing the equality case. The main reference is \cite[\S13.2 and Chapter~14]{Maggi_2012}.

\begin{thm}[Isoperimetric inequality]\label{thm: isoperimetric inequality}
    For every Lebesgue measurable set \(E \subset \R^n\),
    \[
        P(E) \ge n \omega_n^{1/n} |E|^{\frac{n-1}{n}},
    \]
    where \(\omega_n = |B_1|\) is the \(n\)-volume of the standard unit ball of \(\R^n\). Moreover, the equality holds if and only if \(E\) is equivalent to a ball, meaning that there exist \(x \in \R^n\) and \(R>0\) (that necessarily satisfies \(|E|=\omega_nR^n\)) such that \(|E \triangle B_R(x)|=0\).
\end{thm}
In other words, for every \(R>0\)
\[
    \inf \{ P(E) \colon E \subset \R^n, |E|=\omega_n R^n\} = n \omega_n R^{n-1}
\]
and the infimum is realized only by sets equivalent to balls of radius \(R\).

When \(n=1\), this is quite easy.

\begin{thm}[1-dimensional isoperimetric inequality]\label{thm: 1D isoperimetric inequality}
    If \(E \subset \R\) is a non empty Lebesgue measurable set with \(|E|<\infty\), then
    \[
        P(E)\ge 2,
    \]
    with equality if and only if \(E\) is equivalent to an interval of length \(|E|\).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Since \(E \ne \varnothing\) and \(E \ne \R\), \(\chi_E\) is not constant and we have that \(P(E)=|D\chi_E|(\R) >0\). Assume also that \(P(E)<\infty\). Then \(E\) is equivalent to a finite union of disjoint open intervals, so \(P(E)=2N\) where \(N\) is the number of intervals.
\end{proof}

For \(n>1\), the proof of the inequality is not hard: on bounded sets it's just the direct method (cf. Lemma~\ref{lemma: constrained isoperimetric inequality}), and the unbounded case can be obtained by approximating sets of finite perimeter with bounded sets of finite perimeter. 

The actual work is to characterize the equality, i.e., minimizers of the variational problem
\begin{equation}\label{eq: isoperimetric problem with perimeter}
    \alpha(n) = \inf \left\{ \frac{P(E)}{|E|} \colon E \subset \R^n \text{ Lebesgue measurable, } 0<|E|<\infty\right\},
\end{equation}
for \(m>0\) fixed.
A way to proceed is by using the Steiner inequality (cf. Theorem~\ref{thm: steiner inequality}), which states that the Steiner symmetrization does not increase the perimeter. This implies that minimizers must have many symmetries, and it's not hard to deduce that they are balls. Therefore, a sketch of the proof is to show, in order
\begin{itemize}
    \item finite perimeter sets can be approximated by bounded sets with polyhedral boundary (cf. Theorem~\ref{thm: polyhedral approximation});
    \item the Steiner inequality, proving it first on sets with polyhedral boundary and then approximating;
    \item minimizers of \eqref{eq: isoperimetric problem with perimeter} must be equivalent to balls, using the Steiner inequality.
\end{itemize}


Another approach that the authors find interesting is considering the problem from the point of view of differential geometry, i.e., considering the class of smooth compact hypersurfaces that are the boundary of some open bounded set \(\Omega\). Assuming regularity, we can derive formulae for the first and second variation of the perimeter and use much finer tools. However, this point of view has a structural limit in high dimension, as \emph{a priori} it's not clear if the class of smooth hypersurfaces contains minimizers of the isoperimetric problem. We discuss briefly this point of view in the last section of these notes.
